; Graph Coloring Problem in SMT-LIB
; We will color a graph with 6 nodes using 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue)

(set-logic QF_UF)

; Declare colors
(declare-datatypes () ((Color Red Green Blue)))

; Declare variables for each node's color
(declare-const Node1 Color)
(declare-const Node2 Color)
(declare-const Node3 Color)
(declare-const Node4 Color)
(declare-const Node5 Color)
(declare-const Node6 Color)

; Adjacency constraints (edges between nodes)
; Node1 is connected to Node2 and Node3
; Node2 is connected to Node3, Node4, and Node5
; Node3 is connected to Node4 and Node6
; Node4 is connected to Node5 and Node6
; Node5 is connected to Node6
(assert (distinct Node1 Node2))
(assert (distinct Node1 Node3))
(assert (distinct Node2 Node3))
(assert (distinct Node2 Node4))
(assert (distinct Node2 Node5))
(assert (distinct Node3 Node4))
(assert (distinct Node3 Node6))
(assert (distinct Node4 Node5))
(assert (distinct Node4 Node6))
(assert (distinct Node5 Node6))
